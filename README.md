## Applicant List App

To run the app, download the project and open `index.html`.

If you wish to run the dev environment for the app, navigate to the folder directory in terminal and type
```
npm install
```
This will install all relevant node modules and dependencies.

Once all node modules have been downloaded, from the project directory run
```
gulp
```
This will use gulp browsersync, this will spin up an express server locally, it will auto inject any css changes made to main.scss and will auto refresh the page when changes are made to any html files.
